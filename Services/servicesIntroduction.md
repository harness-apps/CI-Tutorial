## Services
Captain Canary here, Thanks for working through this with me. Ok, so our naming team got hired by a large *fruity* company so our intern thought up 'Services'. *Services* is a catch-all term for the *thing* that Harness CI is building. As you might imagine, that can be a *microservice* or a *full application*. In this case, our services are the **frontend** and **backend** portions of our MERN Stack example app. 

If you’re feeling familiar with the Harness UI at this point, dive right in and create those two services. Name them ‘MERN Server and ‘MERN Client’. Services don’t have too many options (or any) so creating them is pretty straightforward. You got this one!
